**Scenario**: The hospital has seen a spike in readmission rates, leading to increased healthcare costs and indicating potential quality of care issues. The administration is concerned about the impact on patient outcomes and the hospitalâ€™s reputation.

The **task** is to analyse hospital admission data to identify patterns and factors associated with high readmission rates.

**Problem statement**: Addressing high readmission rates is crucial for enhancing patient care quality, optimizing hospital resource allocation, and complying with healthcare regulations. Identifying the underlying causes can lead to targeted interventions, improved patient outcomes, and potentially significant cost savings.
